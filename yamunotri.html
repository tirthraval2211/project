                    <p class="detail-text">Yamunotri is the origin of the Yamuna River and the seat of the goddess Yamuna in Hinduism. It is situated at an altitude of 3,293 metres (10,804 ft) in the Garhwal Himalayas and located approximately 150 kilometers (93 mi) North of Uttarkashi, the headquarters of the Uttarkashi district in the Garhwal Division of Uttarakhand, India. It is one of the four sites in India's Chhota Char Dham pilgrimage. The sacred shrine of Yamunotri, source of the river Yamuna, is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, perched atop a flank of Bandar Poonch Parvat. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to the goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Janki Chatti (7 km. Away)
                        The temple of Yamuna, on the left bank of the Yamuna, was constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal. The deity is made of black marble. The Yamuna, like the Ganges, has been elevated to the status of a divine mother for the Hindus and has been held responsible for nurturing and developing the Indian civilization.

                        Close to the temple are hot water springs gushing out from the mountain cavities. Surya Kund is the most important kund. Near the Surya Kund there is a shila called Divya Shila, which is worshipped before puja is offered to the deity. Devotees prepare rice and potatoes to offer at the shrine by dipping them in these hot water springs. Rice so cooked is taken back home as prasadam. The pujaris of Yamunotri come from the village of Kharsali near Janki Chatti. They are the administrators of the sacred place and perform religious ceremonies. They are well-versed in the Shastras.

                <p class="detail-text">According to the legend ancient sage Asit Muni had his hermitage here. All his life, he bathed daily both in the Ganges and the Yamuna. Unable to go to Gangotri during his old age, a stream of the Ganges appeared opposite Yamunotri for him.
                    The temple and the place open every year on the auspicious day of the Akshaya Tritiya, which generally falls during the last week of April, or the first week of May. The temple always closes on the sacred day of Diwali in mid-October - first week of November, with a brief ceremony. The temple staff return to their villages and for the rest of the time the valley is gripped in no-man silence and covered with snow. With the melting of the snow next summer, the temple re-opens.

                <p class="detail-text">Here the approach to the shrine of Yamuna is from the town of Hanumanchatti through the verdant forests, lovely meadows strewn with wild flowers and breath taking views of the surrounding mountains. On the way, at a distance of 13kms. one reaches Janki Chatti and a little ahead is Kharsali, the winter abode of Yamuna. From Jankichatti pilgrims have to trek 13 kms to reach the shrine.
                    Ritual Bathing at Yamunothri Hot Spring / Kund
                    The waters of Yamunothri hot springs (kund) are considered to have curative powers, good for skin diseases. According to Hindu religion the Suraj kund, or hot spring is supposed to be the kitchen for the goddess Yamuna, and anything cooked in the water is considered as prasadam. Boiled potatoes, rice in a muslin cloth are offered to the deity. Also the pilgrims carry potatoes, rice, tied in muslin cloth, put in a copper thali, to dip in kund and carry back as prasad.
