                    <p class="detail-text">The Gangotri Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Goddess Ganga. It is situated on the Greater Himalayan Range in the Uttarkashi district in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is one of the Char Dhams in the Himalayas and serves as the origin of the Ganges.
                        Gangotri is located at a height of 3,100 metres (10,200 feet) near Gomukh, the terminus of the Gangotri Glacier. The origin of the holy river is the Gomukh Glacier, situated about 19 km (12 mi) from the town. According to Hindu mythology, Goddess Ganga took the form of a river to absolve the sins of King Bhagiratha's predecessors, following his severe penance of several centuries.
                        The river is called Bhagirathi at the source and acquires the name Ganga (the Ganges) after joining with Alaknanda river at Devprayag. The origin of the holy river is at Gaumukh, set in the Gangotri Glacier, and is a 19 km trek from Gangotri.

                        Gangotri Temple opened on 18 April 2023 for the 2023 summer season and closed for the winter season from 27 October 2023 (Diwali). It reopened on 10 May 2024 (Akshaya Tritiya). The temple is closed during winters due to extreme weather conditions. During this period, the deity is kept at Mukhba, near Harsil. Ritual duties of the temple are supervised by the Semwal family of pujaris.
                        The importance of Gangotri is derived from the mythology associated with goddess Ganga's descent to Earth. King Sagara, an ancestor of Lord Rama performed the Ashwamedha Yajna (a ritual involving a horse that was let loose to wander) to declare his supremacy. Indra, the Rain God grew jealous and stole the horse and tethered it near sage Kapila, who was meditating.
                        King Sagara's 60,000 sons wrongly accused the sage of stealing the horse and interrupted his meditation. An enraged Kapila burnt them all to ashes. Anshuman, grandson of King Sagara discovered the ashes of his relatives who required proper funeral rites for salvation.

                <p class="detail-text">The Gangotri shrine is considered to be one of the four dhams (pilgrimage sites) of Uttarakhand. The river Ganga originates from the Gangotri glacier as a stream called Bhagirathi at a place called Gaumukh. Pilgrims visiting Gangotri make attempts to reach Gaumukh, situated at a distance of about 19 km from Gangotri, as it is considered to be the actual source of river Ganga.
                    According to Hindu mythology, Goddess Ganga descended on earth as a river to wash away the sins of King Bhagirath's ancestors and she came down at Gangotri. To reduce the impact of her fall, Lord Shiva collected Ganga in his matted locks and released her waters from a single strand of his hair onto the present site of Gangotri.
                    The Gangotri Temple is a beautiful white structure standing nearly 20 feet tall on the banks of the Bhagirathi River. The temple was constructed in the early 18th century by Amar Singh Thapa, a Gurkha general. The temple architecture reflects a blend of Garhwal and Nepali styles.

                <p class="detail-text">The Gangotri region is surrounded by dense forests and incredible mountain vistas. Several treks lead from Gangotri to various places of interest. The Gaumukh Glacier trek is the most popular, taking visitors to the source of the Bhagirathi River. More challenging treks lead to Tapovan, Nandanvan, and Bhojbasa.
                    Gangotri, being a significant religious and tourist destination, has several accommodations and basic facilities. The Gangotri National Park, established in 1989, surrounds the temple area. It is home to various Himalayan animals like the snow leopard, black bear, and musk deer, as well as numerous bird species. The park is renowned for its rich biodiversity and beautiful landscapes dotted with alpine meadows and coniferous forests.
                    Pilgrims who come to Gangotri often go for a holy dip in the Ganges. It's believed that taking a bath in the waters of Ganges washes away one's sins. Another popular ritual is to fill bottles with the holy water to take back home for performing rituals. Devotees also offer prayers at the temple and seek blessings from the deity.
