                <p class ="small-text">The story of Gangotri goes back to the most ancient times. A calm and placid Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand is home to the holy region of Gangotri. Gangotri Dham is located at a height of 3100 m above sea level. From Gangotri Glacier, a great and pious river Ganges arises and is adored by millions of Hindu devotees. Not only is it one of the most visited holy places but also among the top four Char Dham shrines in Uttarakhand.
                    The legends about Gangotri Dham not only evoke history but also resonate with tales. Gangotri Dham, the rise of which runs as fast as time, is as ancient as its beginnings. In the 18th century, the revered Gorkha commander Amar Singh Thapa raised the temple Gangotri. For long the Gangotri Temple has been touching the hearts of pilgrims or devotees with its divine vibrations.
                    Myth and Magic: Mythological Foundation
                    Gangotri Dham is steeped in the mythology of Hinduism as it is a sacred location for the followers of the Hindu faith. The river Ganges, as per Indian mythology is said to have been born from heaven and descended on the journey to beat back the sins of mankind since ancient times. Lord Shiva, out of his benevolence, allowed the holy river to find its earthly beginning at Gangotri and make her home in his locks. Consequently, from the tuft of Lord Shiva‚Äôs matted hair, Mother Ganges descended on earth to provide spiritual healing and grace to the people.

                    It was said that King Bhagirath was the one who performed austerities for the heavenly Ganga to reach Earth. It was a cause to expiate the sins of his progenitors and ancestors. Lord Brahma indeed listened to his prayers and the scared Ganges began to flow. She moves along the footpath created by the hairs of Lord Shiva, which serves as a reminder of the spiritual depths that lie within the very fabric of Gangotri.
