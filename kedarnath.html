                    <p class="detail-text">Kedarnath Temple is a Hindu temple (shrine) dedicated to the Hindu God Lord Shiva. It is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand in India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to Kartik Purnima (the autumn full moon, usually November). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) from Kedarnath temple is brought to Ukhimath and worshipped there for six months. Lord Shiva is worshipped as Kedarnath, the 'Lord of Kedar Khand', the historical name of the region.
                        The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Lord Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.

                        The temple is believed to have been built by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century CE. The present temple was re-constructed by Adi Shankaracharya. The older temple existed even before that and it's believed that it was built by Pandavas (characters from the epic Mahabharata). Pandavas were supposed to be the sign of relief after having won the great war of Mahabharata.
                        In a Hindu religious context, the five Pandava brothers and Draupadi had reached the valley in search of Shiva, who was terrified of the cruel deeds. Shiva changed into the form of a bull to hide himself and was hiding in the region. In the Garhwal region, there are five temples dedicated to Shiva, including the Kedarnath temple, called Panch Kedars. The idols of the deities are in the form of a human body with a bull's head ‚Äì the torso (Kedarnath) and the arms (Tungnath), the face (Rudranath), the navel (Madhyamaheshwar) and the hair (Kalpeshwar).

                <p class="detail-text">Kedarnath temple in 1882 (Photograph from British Library). The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas. It is also one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams, expounded in the Tevaram.
                    Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any "major" damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the floods. The temple was flooded with water resulting in damage to its perimeter walls and surroundings.
                    Pilgrims visiting the Kedarnath Temple have to mostly travel to Rishikesh and Haridwar to start their journey to Kedarnath. Rishikesh has temples and ashrams for worshipers to take the blessings before moving onward to Kedarnath. Haridwar is a town located at Hardwar district of Uttarakhand and has temples, ashrams, Ghats for worship. After Kedarnath, the pilgrimage is now easier and pilgrims can take chardham package tours till Sonprayag to make their journey easier and flexible.

                <p class="detail-text">Kedarnath is named in honour of King Kedar, who ruled in the Satya Yuga. He had a daughter named Vrinda who was a partial incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. She performed austerities for several years and the land is named after her as Vrindavan. However, Kedarnath and its temple is believed to be much older than other temples in the region.
                    According to the Puranas, after the Kurukshetra War the Pandavas undertook a journey to meet Lord Shiva to seek his forgiveness for the sins they had committed during the war by killing their cousins, teachers, and other relatives. This journey was called the Mahaprasthanika Parva. They stopped at a place called Gauri Kund which is 15 km from Kedarnath. This is where the Pandavas bathed in the holy waters. It is believed that Lord Shiva took the form of a bull and hid in the Garhwal Himalayas to escape meeting the Pandavas.
                    When the Pandavas saw the bull (Lord Shiva), Bhima, one of the five Pandavas, recognized the bull and immediately went after him. The bull, Shiva, tried to hide by sinking himself into the ground at Kedarnath. Bhima then caught the bull by its tail. In this process, the bull's back was exposed above the ground, and it eventually disappeared into the ground. This event happened at the site of the present-day garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) of the Kedarnath temple.
